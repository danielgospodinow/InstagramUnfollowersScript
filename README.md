# InstagramUnfollowers
### A script that finds all the bad people who don't follow you back

With the help of [this](https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python) Instagram API, I managed to filter out all the bad unfollowers so I can unfollow them also eventually.

##
### How to use it?

Simply just run the script as it follows: `python3 instagramUnfollowers.py {username} {password}`

##
### Future plans:
- [ ] Storing all the *followers* in a Trie structure to speed up checking if a *following* is a *follower*
